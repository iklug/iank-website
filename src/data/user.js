			"My name is Ian Klug. In the 10 years that I have been a nurse, I have seen ever-advancing technology completely take over and shake up all aspects of our lives. I have also seen a healthcare system that rejects change, technological or otherwise, every chance it gets. I'm trying to change that. ",

		title: "",
		description:
			`I have been in love with technology ever since my little baby hands could grip a mouse. I was also in love with the US Healthcare system after I binged Scrubs DVDs as an impressionable college-bound high schooler. I turned one of those things into my career. Yes, for the last 10 years I have been a registered nurse. I started my nursing journey at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and although every hospital I worked at in Madison, WI used the most up to date electronic medical records (thanks Epic), as I moved around the country I found that this was the exception, not the rule.

			After spending a decade in hospitals, I began to wonder how I would improve the healthcare experience, not only for myself, but for everyone. I began teaching myself JavaScript, React, Node.Js, anything that might help turn ideas into solutions. `,
